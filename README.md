# Nacht des nacherzählten Spiels

This is a simple one-pager for the event series *Nacht des nacherzählten Spiels* from [Gamestorm Berlin](http://gamestorm-berlin.blogspot.de).

We just needed a page to show our recents videos and inform users of past and future events and what we do in general.  
This page is done with the following technologies:

- [Yeoman-Generator gulp-webapp](http://github.com/yeoman/generator-gulp-webapp)
- [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/)
- [jQuery](http://jquery.com/)
- [parallax.js](http://github.com/pixelcog/parallax.js/)
- [perfectScrollbar](http://github.com/noraesae/perfect-scrollbar)

## Install

- just clone the repo
- run `npm install && bower install`
- run `gulp serve`

## Some things I learned

- every jQuery-plugin for parallax effects either do not work or do way to much
- embedding YouTube videos responsively can be harder than expected
- getting access to the Facebook Graph API without the user having to log in to FB first needs some security concerns
